# ARTableTop 3: TokyoDrift
The *third* iteration of ARTableTop. This time, doing it in native Android using Kotlin and SceneForm.  
The original ARTableTop is found [here](https://github.com/Tavaru5/ARTabletop), and was written using Unity either 1 or 3 days after the first ARCore beta came out. It is probably out of date.  
ARTableTop 2: Electric Boogaloo was written using ViroAR with React Native and can be found [here](https://github.com/Tavaru5/ARTableTop2ElectricBoogaloo). It should be a bit less out of date, but it's still in rough shape. (**If you're interested in getting this project to actual production use, this is the project that would be most accessible to users**)
