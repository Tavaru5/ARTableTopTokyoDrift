# ARTableTop 3: TokyoDrift

The _third_ iteration of ARTableTop. This time, doing it in native Android using Kotlin and ARCore/Sceneform.

## Previous iterations

The original ARTableTop is found [here](https://github.com/Tavaru5/ARTabletop), and was written using Unity either 1 or 3 days after the first ARCore beta came out. It is probably out of date.

ARTableTop 2: Electric Boogaloo was written using ViroAR with React Native and can be found [here](https://github.com/Tavaru5/ARTableTop2ElectricBoogaloo). It should be a bit less out of date, but it's still in rough shape. (**If you're interested in getting this project to actual production use, this is the project that would be most accessible to users**)

# Screenshots

This is what it looks like in its current state from two different angles, although these screenshots should be updated to use a better surface.
